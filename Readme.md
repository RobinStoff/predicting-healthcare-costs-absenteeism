## Research Question

Is there a relationship between average weekly working hours and absenteeism due to health problems across EU countries in 2019?

---

## Key Findings

- A strong negative correlation was found between weekly working hours and absenteeism (r = -0.661).
- Linear regression confirmed a statistically significant relationship.
- Countries with longer working hours tend to report lower absenteeism.
- However, this association is not causal and likely reflects structural and institutional differences.
